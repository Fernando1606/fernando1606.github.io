## Fernando Javier Solance Flores

I have just finished my studies on TIC.

Multiplatform develpment.

I learnt about Java, MySQL, PL/SQL, Python, ERP-CRM, Git, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React-Native..

### Main projects

On my [GitHub account](https://github.com/Fernando1606) you can see lot of projects, but there are two of themes that make me by proud of my self.

- [MotorBikeControl:](https://github.com/Fernando1606/MotorBikeControl) This is the final work from my studies. I worked so much on it but it have not finished yet.
- [RSA:](https://github.com/Fernando1606/Encriptaci-n-RSA/tree/master) This Java project works on RSA encryption. It was so hard while I was making it!

### Future

Right now I am learning Python, Spring and C# as you can see on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-solance/) profile where I post every challenge that I 
accomplish.

Right now, I am looking for my first IT job, to keep learning, get experience and be the best!
